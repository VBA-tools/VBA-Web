Excel-REST makes working with complex webservices and APIs easy with Excel. It includes support for authentication, making async requests, automatically converting and parsing JSON, working with cookies and headers, and much more.

Getting started
---------------

- Download the [latest release (v3.1.0)](https://github.com/timhall/Excel-REST/releases)
- To install/upgrade in an existing file, run `install.bat` to walk through installation. 
- To start from scratch, `Excel-REST - Blank.xlsm` has everything setup and ready to go.

For more details see the [Wiki](https://github.com/timhall/Excel-REST/wiki)

Examples
-------

The following examples demonstrate using the Google Maps API to get directions between two locations.

### GetJSON Example
```vbnet
Function GetDirections(Origin As String, Destination As String) As String
    ' Create a RestClient for executing requests
    ' and set a base url that all requests will be appended to
    Dim MapsClient As New RestClient
    MapsClient.BaseUrl = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/"
    
    ' Use GetJSON helper to execute simple request and work with response
    Dim Resource As String
    Dim Response As RestResponse
    
    Resource = "directions/json?origin=" & Origin & "&destination=" & Destination & "&sensor=false"
    Set Response = MapsClient.GetJSON(Resource)
    
    ' => GET https://maps.../api/directions/json?origin=...&destination=...&sensor=false
    
    ProcessDirections Response
End Function

Public Sub ProcessDirections(Response As RestResponse)
    If Response.StatusCode = Ok Then
        Dim Route As Dictionary
        Set Route = Response.Data("routes")(1)("legs")(1)

        Debug.Print "It will take " & Route("duration")("text") & _
            " to travel " & Route("distance")("text") & _
            " from " & Route("start_address") & _
            " to " & Route("end_address")
    Else
        Debug.Print "Error: " & Response.Content
    End If
End Sub
```

There are 3 primary components in Excel-REST: 

1. `RestRequest` for defining complex requests
2. `RestClient` for executing requests
3. `RestResponse` for dealing with responses. 
 
In the above example, the request is fairly simple, so we can skip creating a `RestRequest` and instead use the `Client.GetJSON` helper to GET json from a specific url. In processing the response, we can look at the `StatusCode` to make sure the request succeeded and then use the parsed json in the `Data` parameter to extract complex information from the response. 

### RestRequest Example

If we wish to have more control over the request, the following example uses `RestRequest` to define a complex request.

```vbnet
Function GetDirections(Origin As String, Destination As String) As String
    Dim MapsClient As New RestClient
    ' ... Setup client using GetJSON Example
    
    ' Create a RestRequest for getting directions
    Dim DirectionsRequest As New RestRequest
    DirectionsRequest.Resource = "directions/{format}"
    DirectionsRequest.Method = httpGET
    
    ' Set the request format -> Sets {format} segment, content-types, and parses the response
    DirectionsRequest.Format = json
    
    ' (Alternatively, replace {format} segment directly)
    DirectionsRequest.AddUrlSegment "format", "json"
    
    ' Add parameters to the request (as querystring for GET calls and body otherwise)
    DirectionsRequest.AddParameter "origin", Origin
    DirectionsRequest.AddParameter "destination", Destination
    
    ' Force parameter as querystring for all requests
    DirectionsRequest.AddQuerystringParam "sensor", "false"
    
    ' => GET https://maps.../api/directions/json?origin=...&destination=...&sensor=false
    
    ' Execute the request and work with the response
    Dim Response As RestResponse
    Set Response = MapsClient.Execute(DirectionsRequest)
    
    ProcessDirections Response
End Function

Public Sub ProcessDirections(Response As RestResponse)
    ' ... Same as previous examples
End Sub
```

The above example demonstrates some of the powerful feature available with `RestRequest`. Some of the features include:

- Url segments (Replace {segment} in resource with value)
- Method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Format (json and url-encoded) for content-type and converting/parsing request and response
- Parameters and QuerystringParams
- Body
- Cookies
- Headers

For more details, see the `RestRequest` page in with [Wiki](https://github.com/timhall/Excel-REST/wiki/RestRequest)

### Async Example

The above examples execute synchronously, but Excel-REST can run them asynchronously with ease so that your program can keep working and handle the response later once the request completes.

```vbnet
Function GetDirections(Origin As String, Destination As String) As String
    Dim MapsClient As New RestClient
    Dim DirectionsRequest As New RestRequest
    ' ... Create client and request using RestRequest Example
    
    ' Execute the request asynchronously
    ' Pass in name of Public Sub as callback to be called asynchronously once request completes
    MapsClient.ExecuteAsync DirectionsRequest, "ProcessDirections"
    
    ' Keep working, handling response later
End Function

Public Sub ProcessDirections(Response As RestResponse)
    ' (Called asynchronously!)
    ' ... Same as previous examples
End Sub
```

### Authentication Example

The following example demonstrates using an authenticator with Excel-REST to query Twitter. The `TwitterAuthenticator` (found in the `authenticators/` [folder](https://github.com/timhall/Excel-REST/tree/master/authenticators)) uses Twitter's OAuth 1.0a authentication and details of how it was created can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/timhall/Excel-REST/wiki/Implementing-your-own-IAuthenticator).

```vbnet
Function QueryTwitter(query As String) As RestResponse
    Dim TwitterClient As New RestClient
    TwitterClient.BaseUrl = "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/"
    
    ' Setup authenticator
    Dim TwitterAuth As New TwitterAuthenticator
    TwitterAuth.Setup _
        ConsumerKey:="Your consumer key", _
        ConsumerSecret:="Your consumer secret"
    Set TwitterClient.Authenticator = TwitterAUth
    
    ' Setup query request
    Dim Request As New RestRequest
    Request.Resource = "search/tweets.{format}"
    Request.Format = json
    Request.Method = httpGET
    Request.AddParameter "q", query
    Request.AddParameter "lang", "en"
    Request.AddParameter "count", 20
    
    ' => GET https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=...&lang=en&count=20
    '    Authorization Bearer Token... (received and added automatically via TwitterAuthenticator)
    
    Set QueryTwitter = TwitterClient.Execute(Request)
End Function
```
