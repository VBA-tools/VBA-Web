VBA-Web
=======

VBA-Web (formerly Excel-REST) makes working with complex webservices and APIs easy with VBA on Windows and Mac. It includes support for authentication, automatically converting and parsing JSON, working with cookies and headers, and much more.

Getting started
---------------

- Download the [latest release (v4.1.5)](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/releases)
- To install/upgrade in an existing file, use `VBA-Web - Installer.xlsm`
- To start from scratch in Excel, `VBA-Web - Blank.xlsm` has everything setup and ready to go

For more details see the [Wiki](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/wiki)

Upgrading
---------

To upgrade from Excel-REST to VBA-Web, follow the [Upgrading Guide](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/wiki/Upgrading-from-v3-to-v4)

Note: XML support has been temporarily removed from VBA-Web while parser issues for Mac are resolved.
XML support is still possible on Windows, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/wiki/XML-Support-in-4.0) to use a custom formatter.

Notes
---

- Authentication support is built-in, with suppory for HTTP Basic, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, Windows, Digest, Google, and more. See [Authentication](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/wiki/Authentication) for more information
- For proxy environments, `Client.EnabledAutoProxy = True` will automatically load proxy settings
- Support for custom request and response formats. See [RegisterConverter](http://vba-tools.github.io/VBA-Web/docs/#/WebHelpers/RegisterConverter)

Examples
-------

The following examples demonstrate using the Google Maps API to get directions between two locations.

### GetJSON Example
```VB.net
Function GetDirections(Origin As String, Destination As String) As String
    ' Create a WebClient for executing requests
    ' and set a base url that all requests will be appended to
    Dim MapsClient As New WebClient
    MapsClient.BaseUrl = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/"

    ' Use GetJSON helper to execute simple request and work with response
    Dim Resource As String
    Dim Response As WebResponse

    Resource = "directions/json?" & _
        "origin=" & Origin & _
        "&destination=" & Destination & _
        "&sensor=false"
    Set Response = MapsClient.GetJSON(Resource)

    ' => GET https://maps.../api/directions/json?origin=...&destination=...&sensor=false

    ProcessDirections Response
End Function

Public Sub ProcessDirections(Response As WebResponse)
    If Response.StatusCode = WebStatusCode.Ok Then
        Dim Route As Dictionary
        Set Route = Response.Data("routes")(1)("legs")(1)

        Debug.Print "It will take " & Route("duration")("text") & _
            " to travel " & Route("distance")("text") & _
            " from " & Route("start_address") & _
            " to " & Route("end_address")
    Else
        Debug.Print "Error: " & Response.Content
    End If
End Sub
```

There are 3 primary components in VBA-Web:

1. `WebRequest` for defining complex requests
2. `WebClient` for executing requests
3. `WebResponse` for dealing with responses.

In the above example, the request is fairly simple, so we can skip creating a `WebRequest` and instead use the `Client.GetJSON` helper to GET json from a specific url. In processing the response, we can look at the `StatusCode` to make sure the request succeeded and then use the parsed json in the `Data` parameter to extract complex information from the response.

### WebRequest Example

If you wish to have more control over the request, the following example uses `WebRequest` to define a complex request.

```VB.net
Function GetDirections(Origin As String, Destination As String) As String
    Dim MapsClient As New WebClient
    MapsClient.BaseUrl = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/"

    ' Create a WebRequest for getting directions
    Dim DirectionsRequest As New WebRequest
    DirectionsRequest.Resource = "directions/{format}"
    DirectionsRequest.Method = WebMethod.HttpGet

    ' Set the request format
    ' -> Sets content-type and accept headers and parses the response
    DirectionsRequest.Format = WebFormat.Json

    ' Replace {format} segment
    DirectionsRequest.AddUrlSegment "format", "json"

    ' Add querystring to the request
    DirectionsRequest.AddQuerystringParam "origin", Origin
    DirectionsRequest.AddQuerystringParam "destination", Destination
    DirectionsRequest.AddQuerystringParam "sensor", "false"

    ' => GET https://maps.../api/directions/json?origin=...&destination=...&sensor=false

    ' Execute the request and work with the response
    Dim Response As WebResponse
    Set Response = MapsClient.Execute(DirectionsRequest)

    ProcessDirections Response
End Function

Public Sub ProcessDirections(Response As WebResponse)
    ' ... Same as previous example
End Sub
```

The above example demonstrates some of the powerful feature available with `WebRequest`. Some of the features include:

- Url segments (Replace {segment} in resource with value)
- Method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Format (json, xml, url-encoded, plain-text) for content-type and accept headers and converting/parsing request and response
- QuerystringParams
- Body
- Cookies
- Headers

For more details, see the `WebRequest` portion of the [Docs](https://vba-tools.github.io/VBA-Web/docs/)

### Authentication Example

The following example demonstrates using an authenticator with VBA-Web to query Twitter. The `TwitterAuthenticator` (found in the `authenticators/` [folder](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/tree/master/authenticators)) uses Twitter's OAuth 1.0a authentication and details of how it was created can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web/wiki/Implementing-your-own-IAuthenticator).

```VB.net
Function QueryTwitter(Query As String) As WebResponse
    Dim TwitterClient As New WebClient
    TwitterClient.BaseUrl = "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/"

    ' Setup authenticator
    Dim TwitterAuth As New TwitterAuthenticator
    TwitterAuth.Setup _
        ConsumerKey:="Your consumer key", _
        ConsumerSecret:="Your consumer secret"
    Set TwitterClient.Authenticator = TwitterAuth

    ' Setup query request
    Dim Request As New WebRequest
    Request.Resource = "search/tweets.json"
    Request.Format = WebFormat.Json
    Request.Method = WebMethod.HttpGet
    Request.AddQuerystringParam "q", Query
    Request.AddQuerystringParam "lang", "en"
    Request.AddQuerystringParam "count", 20

    ' => GET https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=...&lang=en&count=20
    '    Authorization Bearer Token... (received and added automatically via TwitterAuthenticator)

    Set QueryTwitter = TwitterClient.Execute(Request)
End Function
```
